\section{Maaike de Jong}
%This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

List of glorious topics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Some fantastic comments about the module.
	\item A section lacking a selfie with Max.
	\item More unintelligible gibberish.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
This module has been fantastic so far. Wow, such module. Much goodness. 


\subsection{Selfie with Max}

But how are we to include a selfie, if Max isn't here?! Not that he'd have appreciated over a hundred students rushing him to try and take a picture, but still.
I'd add some glorious paint art, but... Well. Perhaps in due time.

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\caption{Selfie with Max}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ImgName}
%\label{fig:selfie}
%\end{figure}

%You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref$. you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

% My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
This module, I have learned many things. Many things. Great things. The best of things.
(I'm sorry none of this is of any worth but I'm really just wanting to practice git and Tex)
